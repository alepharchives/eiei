EIEI
====

EIEI is a small library that adds a set of convenience functions to Erlang's
EI library. Erlang's EI library provides both encode and decode functions to
encode and decode erlang terms. The ei_x variant of encode functions use a dynamic buffer. There is no equivalent ei_x set of functions that operate on an
ei_x_buff structure.

This library primarily adds ei_x_decode_* functions as a conveniance.

Enjoy!
